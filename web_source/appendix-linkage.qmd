# Linkage process {#sec-linkage}

This section provides an overview of the linkage process (Figure 2.2) used to create the 
ECHILD database. 

## Data sources

### The Department for Education's National Pupil Database 

The Department for Education (DfE) collates and manages data on school children in England 
in a resource known as the National Pupil Database (NPD) [@jay2019a]. For the purposes of 
the ECHILD linkage, salient points are described below. Within NPD, each record is associated 
with natural identifiers (forename, surname, gender, date of birth, postcode) relating to the 
pupil's details as known by the submitting organisation at the time the data were submitted. 
DfE additionally assigns each record in NPD an anonymised Pupil Matching Reference (aPMR). An 
aPMR is an identifier which is not in itself meaningful: it does not reveal the identity of 
the pupil. aPMRs are assigned to all records in NPD such that one aPMR should represent one 
pupil and each pupil should have only one aPMR. This allows records for each pupil to be 
identified across NPD, both between different datasets and over time, without revealing 
their identity. As a result, NPD contains a longitudinal record of pupils' names, addresses, 
and (potentially) genders over time.

### NHS England's Personal Demographics Service and Master Person Service 

NHS England operates the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a national electronic database 
of demographic data for patients accessing care in England or services funded by the NHS in 
England. PDS contains natural identifiers (forename, surname, gender, date of birth, 
postcode) and NHS number. Each person is assigned a distinct NHS number at birth if born in 
England, or at the first time of accessing NHS services in England if not otherwise 
registered. PDS holds a longitudinal record of name and address changes made to NHS services 
in England over time. This means there may be many records for each person in PDS but all 
records for a person should be assigned the same NHS number (with some exceptions, see 
reference [@nhsprimarycare2023a]). 

The Master Person Service (MPS), managed by NHS England [@nhse2023m], takes a record of 
natural identifiers and attempts to match this to a PDS record allowing for some errors and 
missingness in the recording of the natural identifiers. If this fails and the natural 
identifiers are sufficiently complete, MPS attempts to match records against a secondary 
store (MPS bucket) of natural identifiers of persons who previously had contact with the 
NHS in England and do not have an NHS number, these persons are assigned an 'MPS ID'.

The MPS returns a "Person ID" using either: 

1. NHS number, if a valid match is found in PDS; or,
2. MPS ID if no match is found in PDS but a valid match is found in the MPS bucket; or,
3. No value if no match is found in either PDS or the MPS bucket.

The Person ID is then encrypted to generate a Token Person ID (TPI), which is not meaningful 
and does not reveal the person's identity.

Person IDs, enabling the assignment of Token Person IDs, are also recorded throughout NHS 
England's standard data collections, including Hospital Episode Statistics datasets, 
Emergency Care Datasets, Mental Health Services Datasets, and Community Services Datasets. 
The 'Person ID' is the only routine means of identify records belonging to the same patient 
amongst data held by NHS England.

## Linking DfE NPD aPMRs to NHS England TPIs 

For the purposes of the ECHILD linkage, the following simplifying assumptions were made:

1. Each aPMR represents precisely one "real" person within NPD;
1. Each TPI represents precisely one "real" person within NHS England data collections;
1. Each "real" person represented within NHS England data collections has precisely one TPI.

Essentially, whilst we assume TPI's are perfectly allocated, we only require that aPMRs are 
not shared. That is, the same "real" person is permitted to have more than one aPMR.

The linkage task resulted in 'N-to-one' links between aPMRS and TPIs: linking each aPMR 
to a single TPI but, a TPI may be linked to more than one aPMR. However, the vast majority 
of links made were '1-to-1'.

DfE supplied a 'linkage dataset' to NHS England, comprising the natural identifiers 
(forename, surname, gender, date of birth, postcode) and an aPMR for each record in its NPD.

### Linkage Stage 1: Exact link 

An initial, simple, linkage stage was used to avoid over-burdening the more 
resource-intensive MPS trace. Each valid record (e.g., no blank entries) in the linkage 
dataset was compared to all records in a prepared extract from PDS. A record was deemed 
"linked" if compared records matched on the following criteria:

1. First four characters of forename;
1. Full surname;
1. Full date of birth;
1. Full postcode; and,
1. Gender.

Further, an aPMR was considered 'linked' if all of its associated linkage records were 
linked to at most one TPI and at least one record was 'linked' to a TPI.

### Linkage Stage 2: MPS Trace 

Records with aPMRs that were not 'linked' in Linkage Stage 1 were submitted to MPS. 
Again, an aPMR was considered 'linked' only if all of its associated linkage records 
were linked to at most one TPI and at least one record was 'linked' to a TPI.

### Linkage Outputs: Pseudonymised bridging file 

NHS England produced a pseudonymised bridging file consisting of all aPMRs in the 
DfE-supplied linkage dataset and their linked TPI. All aPMRs that were not matched 
after Linkage Stage 2 were included in this file but did not have an assigned TPI. 
An additional variable indicating at what stage each aPMR was linked was also 
present in the NHS England pseudonymised bridging file.
