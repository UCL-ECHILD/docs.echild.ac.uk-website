# Linkage process {#sec-linkage}

This section provides an overview of the linkage process (Figure 2.2) used to create the ECHILD database. 

## Data sources

### The Department for Education’s National Pupil Database 

The Department for Education (DfE) collates and manages data on school children 
in England in a resource known as the National Pupil Database (NPD).[6] For the 
purposes of the ECHILD linkage, salient points are described below. Within NPD, 
each record is associated with natural identifiers (forename, surname, gender, 
date of birth, postcode) relating to the pupil’s details as known by the 
submitting organisation at the time the data were submitted. DfE additionally 
assigns each record in NPD an anonymised Pupil Matching Reference (aPMR). An 
aPMR is an identifier which is not in itself meaningful: it does not reveal the 
identity of the pupil. aPMRs are assigned to all records in NPD such that one 
aPMR should represent one pupil and each pupil should have only one aPMR. This 
allows records for each pupil to be identified across NPD, both between 
different datasets and over time, without revealing their identity. As a 
result, NPD contains a longitudinal record of pupils’ names, addresses, and 
(potentially) genders over time.

### NHS England’s Personal Demographics Service and Master Person Service 

NHS England operates the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a national 
electronic database of demographic data for patients accessing care in England 
or services funded by the NHS in England. PDS contains natural identifiers 
(forename, surname, gender, date of birth, postcode) and NHS number. Each 
person is assigned a distinct NHS number at birth if born in England, or at the 
first time of accessing NHS services in England if not otherwise registered. 
PDS holds a longitudinal record of name and address changes made to NHS 
services in England over time. This means there may be many records for each 
person in PDS but all records for a person should be assigned the same NHS 
number (with some exceptions, see reference [67]). 

The Master Person Service (MPS), managed by NHS England,[68] takes a record of 
natural identifiers and attempts to match this to a PDS record allowing for 
some errors and missingness in the recording of the natural identifiers. If 
this fails and the natural identifiers are sufficiently complete, MPS attempts 
to match records against a secondary store (MPS bucket) of natural identifiers 
of persons who previously had contact with the NHS in England and do not havean 
NHS number, these persons are assigned an ‘MPS ID’.

The MPS returns a “Person ID” using either: 

1. NHS number, if a valid match is found in PDS; or,
1. MPS ID if no match is found in PDS but a valid match is found in the MPS 
bucket; or,
1. No value if no match is found in either PDS or the MPS bucket.

The Person ID is then encrypted to generate a Token Person ID (TPI), which is 
not meaningful and does not reveal the person’s identity.

Person IDs, enabling the assignment of Token Person IDs, are also recorded 
throughout NHS England’s standard data collections, including Hospital Episode 
Statistics datasets, Emergency Care Datasets, Mental Health Services Datasets, 
and Community Services Datasets. The ‘Person ID’ or ‘TPI’ are primarily the 
only means to identify records belonging to a single patient amongst data held 
by NHS England.

## Linking DfE NPD aPMRs to NHS England TPIs 

For the purposes of the ECHILD linkage, four simplifying assumptions were made:

1. Each aPMR represents precisely one “real” person within NPD;
1. Each “real” person represented within NPD has precisely one aPMR;
1. Each TPI represents precisely one “real” person within NHS England data 
collections;
1. Each “real” person represented within NHS England data collections has 
precisely one TPI.

The linkage task resulted in a ‘one-to-one’ match, linking each aPMR to a 
single TPI. 

DfE supplied a ‘linkage dataset’ to NHS England, comprising the natural 
identifiers (forename, surname, gender, date of birth, postcode) and an aPMR 
for each record in its NPD.

### Linkage Stage 1: Exact link 

An initial, simple, linkage stage was used to avoid over-burdening the more 
resource-intensive MPS trace. Each valid record (e.g., no blank entries) in the 
linkage dataset was compared to all records in a prepared extract from PDS. A 
record was deemed “linked” if compared records matched on the following 
criteria:

1. First four characters of forename;
1. Full surname;
1. Full date of birth;
1. Full postcode; and,
1. Gender.

An aPMR was considered ‘matched’ if it had a one-to-one link to a TPI. 

### Linkage Stage 2: MPS Trace 

Records with aPMRs that were not ‘matched’ in Linkage Stage 1 were submitted to 
MPS. Again, an aPMR was considered ‘matched’ if it had a one-to-one link to a 
TPI.

### Linkage Outputs: Pseudonymised Bridging file 

NHS England produced a Pseudonymised Bridging file consisting of all aPMRs in 
the DfE-supplied linkage dataset and their "matched” TPI. All aPMRs that were 
not matched after Linkage Stage 2 were included in this file but did not have 
an assigned TPI. An additional variable indicating at what stage each aPMR was 
linked was also present in the NHS England bridge file.
