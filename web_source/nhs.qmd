# Health data {#sec-data-hes}

The data collections detailed below are supplied by NHS England. NHS England is responsible 
for the collation of all these except for birth and death registration data, these are 
collated by the Office for National Statistics.

## Hospital Episode Statistics

HES contains hospital records for all NHS patients in England, including patient 
demographics and standardised codes for diagnoses, symptoms and procedures relating 
to the care they have received [@nhse2023b]. The datasets are collected by NHSE from 
hospital care providers and curated on an ongoing basis. However, data from other 
health providers such as General Practitioners (GPs) or pharmacies are not included. 
HES datasets are collated by financial year (1st April to 31st March) and following processing and quality 
assessment, the finalised datasets are released for secondary use and remain 
unchanged thereafter [@boyd2017a].

### Admitted Patient Care

Records within the Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset are called 'hospital episodes', 
and each episode relates to a period of care for a patient under a single consultant 
(consultant episode) within one hospital provider [@herbert2017a; @boyd2017a; @hdr2023b]. 
The time from initial admission to discharge is called a 'spell', defined as 'periods of 
continuous care in one provider institution' and each admission spell can be made up of 
many episodes. APC data contain 'Finished Admission Episodes' (FAEs) which is the first 
episode in a spell of care, and 'Finished Consultant Episodes' (FCEs), which is a 
continuous period of care under one consultant. Only FCEs concluded within the financial 
year (from 1st April to the end of 31st March) are included. Patients with an unfinished consultant 
episode in the current financial year will have their record represented as a finished 
episode in the next financial year of HES data.

#### Inpatient spell (single hospital)

A hospital admission commences when a patient is initially admitted for care and ends 
when a patient is discharged, transferred, or dies.

One spell of admission encompasses multiple episodes of care under an different 
consultant.

episodes within one hospital admission, all comprising one spell."}

#### Continuous Inpatient spell (across multiple hospitals)

In some instances, admitted patients who require specialised treatment may be 
transferred from one hospital to another more specialist hospital, e.g., transfer 
to a Children's hospital.

## Data collections

### Acute Hospital Admitted Care data collections

| Dataset | Years | Details |
|:--------|:---|:-----------|
| Admitted Patient Care (APC)[^4] | 1997 to 2023 | Episode-level dataset of patients admitted for treatment (i.e., requiring the use of a hospital bed), at NHS hospitals in England; includes delivery and birth data, up to 20 diagnostic codes per episode and procedure codes [@herbert2017a; @nhse2024b; @hdr2023b]. |
| Critical Care (CC)[^5] | 2007 to 2023 | Episode-level dataset of patients admitted for treatment and receiving Critical Care (intensive care or high dependency care) at NHS hospitals in England. Treatment in adult designated wards where constant support and monitoring are required to maintain at least one organ (i.e., an Intensive Care or High Dependency Unit) [@hdr2023e; nhse2024c].|

[^1]: Diagnoses are recorded using the International Classification of
    Disease (ICD) version 10 and procedures are recorded using the
    Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) version 4.
    Diagnoses and procedures have very low levels of completeness in the
    Outpatient dataset (5% and 26%, respectively) [@boyd2017a].

[^2]: See footnote 1.

### Acute Hospital Attendance data collections

| Dataset | Years | Details |
|:--------|:---|:-----------|
| Outpatients (OPA)[^1] | 2003 to 2023 | Outpatient appointments at English NHS hospitals and NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector (regardless of whether the appointment was attended or not) [@nhse2023c; @hdr2023c]. In 2003/04, the OP module was considered experimental and did not have complete coverage as not all providers completed data submissions. |
| Accident & Emergency (A&E)[^2] | 2007 to 2020 | Attendance level dataset collecting information about the treatment received by patients attending A&E Departments, Minor Injury Units and Walk-In Centres, in England [@nhse2023f; @hdr2023d]. Please note diagnoses aren’t consistently captured in A&E records. |
| Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS)[^3] | 2020 to 2023 | In 2018, the A&E dataset was replaced by the ECDS which is now the national dataset for Urgent & Emergency care [@nhse2023d; @nhse2023j; @hdr2023d]. Please note diagnoses aren’t consistently captured in ECDS records. |

[^3]: See footnote 1.

[^4]: Bespoke codes are used to record diagnoses and treatments
    [@nhse2023e]; however, these are much more limited than ICD-10 and
    OPCS-4 codes. Prior to 2012/13, the A&E module was considered
    experimental and did not have complete coverage as not all providers
    completed data submissions [@nhse2023f].

[^5]: ECDS uses a subset of SNOMED CT codes to record diagnoses and
    treatments (amongst other variables) [@nhse2023d; @nhse2023j].


### Mental Health data collections

| Dataset | Years | Details |
|:--------|:---|:-----------|
| Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS) | 2016 to 2023 | Patient-level dataset that records all activity relating to patients, including children, who receive assessments and treatment from Mental Health Services in England, where the patient has (or is thought to have): either a mental health condition; a need for support with their mental well-being; a learning disability; autism; or any other neurodevelopmental condition [@nhse2023g]. |
| Mental Health & Learning Disabilities Data Set | 2014 to 2016 | Disabilities Data Set Data is collected for patients who were in contact with adult mental health services [@nhse2024d]. |
| Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS)| 2006 to 2016 | The MHMDS was the preliminary dataset capturing data about the use of adult Mental Health Services in England. However, the MHMDS was superseded by the Mental Health & Learning Disabilities Data Set, which in turn was superseded by the MHSDS [@nhse2024d]. |

### Maternity and Birth data collections

| Dataset | Years | Details |
|:--------|:---|:-----------|
| Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS) | 2015 to 2023 | The MSDS is a patient-level dataset that captures information about activity carried out by Maternity Services relating to a mother and baby(ies), from the point of the first booking appointment until the mother and baby(ies) are discharged from maternity services. The MSDS collects records of each stage of the maternity service care pathway in NHS-funded maternity services and includes information not recorded in HES [@nhse2023h; @hdr2023a].  |
| Birth Notification Data | 2001 to 2023 | Birth notification is a document completed by the doctor or midwife present at birth occurring in an NHS facility in England, Wales and the Isle of Man. The baby's NHS Number is issued as part of the 'statutory notification of birth'. Birth notification data includes information that is not found in the birth registration data such as gestation age and ethnicity of the baby as stated by the mother [@nhse2023i]. |
| Birth Registration Data | 1996 to 2022 | Birth Registration Data includes information recorded when live births and stillbirths are registered. It is a legal requirement to register all births in England and Wales. These registrations are lodged with a local registry office and collated by the General Register Office (for England and Wales). The General Register Office shares these data with the Office for National Statistics which processes these data and further shares the data with NHS England. All registered births are included except very late registrations received more than 14 months after the end of each reference year (there are fewer than 100 of these for any given year) [@ons2023a]. |



### Other data collections

| Dataset | Years | Details |
|:--------|:---|:-----------|
| Death Registration Data | 1998 to 2023 | It is a legal requirement to register all deaths in England and Wales. Death registrations are lodged with a local registry office and collated by the General Register Office (for England and Wales). The General Register Office shares these data with the Office for National Statistics which processes these data and further shares the data with NHS England. Death Registration Data contains information taken from death certificates for all deaths registered in England and Wales and includes cause of death, date and place of death. Information related to stillbirths is not available in this data, see Birth Registration Data. Some deaths, particularly those referred to a coroner, may not be registered until long after the date of death. |
| Community Services Data Set (CSDS) | 2015 to 2023 | The CSDS captures activity data about children and adults collected by Community Services, including health visiting teams. Such activities may take place in settings such as Health centres; Day care facilities; Schools or Community centres; Mobile facilities, or a patient's own home [@nhse2023l]. Data are collected about children and adults e.g., personal, demographic or social circumstances; breastfeeding and nutrition; long-term conditions (disabilities), diagnoses and scored assessments. The CSDS is comprised of patient-level data from all publicly funded community services providers e.g., Foundation or Non-Foundation Trusts; Acute Trusts; Mental health Trusts, Community Healthcare Trusts, Independent sector providers and Local Authorities. CSDS data are inconsistently captured over time and aren’t really useable before 2018/19 (Clery et al., 2024). |
