# Ethics self-assessment {#sec-access-ethics .unnumbered}

It is important to consider the ethical aspects of any study involving secondary analysis of de-identified administrative data; although the data are de-identified, no study is free of risk. Researchers applying to use ECHILD will be asked to complete a Self-Assessment form [ADD LINK] [43] to assess compliance of their proposed project with the ethical principles developed by the National Statisticianâ€™s Data Ethics Advisory Committee.
