# Mother-baby Linkage in ECHILD {#sec-mother-baby-linkage}

The ECHILD team have created a 'mother-baby' link [@Feng2024a], whereby HES delivery and birth records for both mother and baby 
are linked together using a probabilistic linkage algorithm [@harron2016a]. In summary, the probabilistic linkage approach uses 
'indirect identifiers' (such as gestational age and birth weight) to link together mother-baby dyads. Previous work has 
demonstrated high linkage rates using this approach [@Feng2024b]. The mother-baby linkage means that it is possible within 
ECHILD to look at how maternal characteristics (including those captured in health, education and social care datasets) are 
related to child outcomes. It is also possible to identify sibling clusters.
