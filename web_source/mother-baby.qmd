# Mother-baby Linkage in ECHILD {#sec-mother-baby-linkage}

The ECHILD team are in the process of creating a 'mother-baby' link, whereby HES delivery 
and birth records for both mother and baby will be linked together using a probabilistic 
linkage algorithm.[40] In summary, the probabilistic linkage approach uses 'indirect 
identifiers', i.e., information from the maternity and baby tails within HES (such as 
gestational age and birth weight) to link together mother-baby dyads. Previous work has 
demonstrated high linkage rates using this approach [harron2016a]. The mother-baby 
linkage means that it is possible within ECHILD to look at how maternal characteristics 
(including those captured in health, education and social care datasets) are related to 
child outcomes.
