## Includes information related to health, education & social care 

HES and NPD are well-established administrative datasets for health, education and social care in England. These datasets act as an evidence base to inform policy: they are used to produce national statistics by government departments and for wider research purposes by the academic community. However, the lack of a common identifier in these administrative datasets has limited the potential for wide-scale analysis across domains. By linking health, education and social care datasets, ECHILD presents a unique and valuable opportunity to explore how childrenâ€™s health affects their education, and how their education affects their health. 

## Longitudinal data resource for a whole population-based cohort of children & young people 

All children and young people in England who were born between 01/09/1984 to date (updated annually) are eligible for inclusion in ECHILD. Overall, the dataset contains linked health and education records for approximately 20 million individuals. The large sample size and long follow-up period will enable research into long-term outcomes and less common exposures. The ambition is for ECHILD to be updated in the future to include more recent years of data as they become available. This would extend the length of follow-up for cohort members who were born more recently. 

## Comprises well-documented administrative datasets 

The constituent datasets within ECHILD are well-documented by data owners[9, 45] and the research community.[6, 10, 46-49] For example, details about how information in the datasets is collected, what variables they contain and how coding has changed over time are readily available to researchers. Appendix 1 highlights some key resources for researchers.

## Provides timely access to administrative data for research purposes 

Negotiating access with multiple administrative data providers is time-consuming and resource intensive, particularly when it involves the transfer of identifiable information for linkage purposes.[50] Governance arrangements for the re-use of the de-identified ECHILD data for research purposes via the ONS SRS are now established. This will avoid the need for repeated transfer and use of identifiable information to link HES and NPD data for individual research projects.
