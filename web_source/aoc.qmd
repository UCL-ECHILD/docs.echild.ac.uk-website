# Assured Organisational Connectivity (AOC) {#sec-access-aoc}

An 
[AOC agreement](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/accessthedatasecurely#assured-organisational-connectivity-aoc) 
is an agreement between your organisation and the ONS concerning how your 
organisation meets the required physical and system security standard to 
directly allow access to the SRS from your organisation or your home office 
space. All AOC agreements must be approved by the ONS and it is the 
responsibility of the researcher to check if an institutional AOC is in place 
before applying for access to ECHILD.
