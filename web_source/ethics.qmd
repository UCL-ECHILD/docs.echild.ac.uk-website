# Ethics self-assessment {#sec-access-ethics}

It is important to consider the ethical aspects of any study involving the secondary analysis of de-identified administrative data; although the data are de-identified, no study is entirely free of risk. While completing a [Self-Assessment form](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-authority-board/committees/national-statisticians-advisory-committees-and-panels/national-statisticians-data-ethics-advisory-committee/ethics-self-assessment-tool/) is not required to apply for access to ECHILD data, it is still recommended. This form helps researchers assess their project's compliance with the ethical principles developed by the National Statisticianâ€™s Data Ethics Advisory Committee.
