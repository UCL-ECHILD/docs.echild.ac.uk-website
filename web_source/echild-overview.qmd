# ECHILD {#sec-echild .unnumbered}

## Information Scope 

In England, information on a childâ€™s journey through education and social care is recorded in administrative records 
held by the Department for Education (the National Pupil Database; NPD). NHS England holds information about all 
NHS hospital contacts (captured in Hospital Episode Statistics; HES). HES records are generated for the purposes of 
service delivery, e.g., to support financial reimbursement for treatment relating to a hospital stay. 
Within ECHILD, healthcare, education and social care records have been linked to create a longitudinal database that 
follows children over time. The database is very useful for research as health, education and social care trajectories 
are strongly interrelated from childhood to adulthood. ECHILD provides a valuable opportunity to explore these 
relationships and to generate evidence for policy and practice.[@mcgrathlone2021a]

## Key research purposes 
ECHILD will only be used for research that has a clear public benefit in England and Wales to improve the health and 
well-being of children and young people accessing health, education and social care services. The specific research 
purposes (permitted uses) are below (in bold) with examples of relevant research questions.

1. Informing preventative strategies by Healthcare and Education services e.g., do disabled children attending 
schools, or living in areas that provide a good level of disability support in school or through social care 
services, have lower rates of unplanned hospital contacts compared with less supportive schools/areas? 
1. Informing children and their parents e.g., about variation in special educational needs support and outcomes 
for children with chronic health conditions or disability.
1. Informing education and clinical practice e.g., investigating whether associations between chronic health 
conditions and lower school attainment are explained by school absence. 
1. Identifying groups who could benefit from intervention e.g., what are the health outcomes of children post 
age 16 who have contact with social care services or have special educational needs? 
1. Understanding the most effective methods for working with linked health and education data e.g., what are 
the most effective methods for working with linked health and education data?
