# Access conditions {#sec-access-access-conditions}

Researchers will have to demonstrate how their research will benefit the health and well-being of children and young people accessing health, education and social care services. More specifically, projects will have to fall under at least one of the agreed five research purposes described in @sec-echild-key-purposes. We do not have approval for non-UCL PhD students without a substantive contract at an applying institution to access ECHILD.

Researchers will be expected to:

1. State their use of ECHILD in any publication/presentation and acknowledge the ECHILD team in publications and reports, including the following acknowledgements/notes where possible: *We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the wider ECHILD Database support and programme management.*
1. Undertake appropriate Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE)
activities.
1. Refer to 
[ONS guidance](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/gettingyourresearchoutputsapproved) regarding pre-publication, publication and code file 
clearance. 
1. Notify and provide details in writing of all publications to UCL 14 days in 
advance of publication.
1. Notify and provide draft publications to the Department for Education 14 
days in advance of any publication.
