# Information scope {#sec-echild-information-scope}

In England, information on a child’s journey through education and social care is recorded in administrative records held by the Department for Education (the National Pupil Database; NPD). NHS England holds information about all NHS hospital contacts (captured in Hospital Episode Statistics; HES). HES records are generated for the purposes of service delivery, e.g., to support financial reimbursement for treatment relating to a hospital stay.

Within ECHILD, healthcare, education and social care records have been linked to create a longitudinal database that follows children over time. The database is very useful for research as health, education and social care trajectories are strongly interrelated from childhood to adulthood. ECHILD provides a valuable opportunity to explore these relationships and to generate evidence for policy and practice [@mcgrathlone2021a].
